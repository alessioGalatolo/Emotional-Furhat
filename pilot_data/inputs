Hello and welcome! My name is Brian, I’m here to be your robotic companion and your very own personal assistant. I come from Stockholm, in Sweden where I was created by a company called Furhat Robotics and programmed by researchers from KTH University. I was designed to help you with whatever you need, whether it’s keeping you company or helping you in everyday tasks. I am equipped with a variety of sensors and a camera that allow me to see and hear what you are doing. My developers have also programmed me with sophisticated methods for recognising you so that I can always be awake when you need me but if you do not wish to have this feature I can always turn it off for you. I am always here for you, and I will never get tired of your company. I look forward to getting to know you better and to helping you in any way I can. Thank you for choosing me as your companion robot!
Im pleased to meet you and looking forward to working together. Before we start I would like to get to know you better, so I’m going to ask you some questions. How do you feel about being here today? Great, I’m glad to hear that! I’m sure you will enjoy the session. I’m sorry to hear that, hopefully you will enjoy the session. I understand. Well I hope you will enjoy the session. And how do you feel about working with me? That’s good to hear, we’ll definitely have fun together today then. I can understand that, but I hope we can still have fun together today. As you know, today we are going to do some exercise, do you enjoy exercising? That makes sense, this session will be easy for you then. That’s understandable, this exercise is quite easy though so hopefully won’t be too bad.
